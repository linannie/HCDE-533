		<h3>Assembling the 3D Printer</h3>
		<p class="myp">For this portion I don’t have many photos because I set up my printer 2 weeks ago but it took me a few hours to put everything together. The instructions that were provided with my Ender 3 weren’t super informative, only providing images, so a few steps on the instructions weren’t clear to understand. Here are some pictures that I managed to take while I was assembling the 3D printer.  </p>
		
		

		<table>
       		<tr>
       			<td>
       				<div class="pic">

		<h3>Adjusting Extruder’s nuts</h3>
		
       <p class="myp">
       My extruder’s nuts weren’t loose when I assembled my printer, so this was something I didn’t have to do. I still double checked if they were tight enough.  </p>

	    <br>

		<h3>Checking for Loose Screws</h3>
		<p class="myp">Overall, I made sure to tighten all the screws on my printer. A few screws loosened up later during my print, but I’ll get into that in a bit.  </p> <br>

		<h3>Other Problems while assembling</h3>
		<p class="myp">The belt on the x-axis wasn’t tight, so when I tried turning on my machine and pressing the Auto Home setting, I would get a “Homing Failed” please reset printer error. My friend Kaitlyn helped me tighten the belt along the x-axis. </p> <br>

		<h3>Adjusting the Build Plate Level</h3>


		<p class="myp">This step was by far the most frustrating for me because I spent 2 days trying to adjust the build plate level. I followed the video provided from the slide deck on Canvas, and I downloaded the bed leveling files. Initially my bed was too low, and the extruder was too high, so when I tried to raise the bed, the bottom left adjustment knob would just completely come out. Because of this, I adjusted the z-limit switch to be lower, so the extruder would reach closer to the bed, which seemed to work better; I was able to adjust the knobs properly. </p>

		<p class="myp">Initially my filament wasn’t properly adhering to the bed. When I tightened the knobs to raise the bed, then the extruder was too close. There was a lot of trial and error and minute adjustments on the knobs and the Z-limit switch to finally level the bed.</p>

		<p class="myp">My filament bowden tube was loose, and I had to change my filament (I used the provided filament from Creality initially) so my filament wasn’t coming out properly. However, I finally managed to level my bed after some time. </p><br>

		<table class="imgTable">
       		<tr>

		<h3>Modeling in Rhino</h3>
		<p class="myp">While I was leveling my bed, I figured I should spend time creating the files that needed to be printed. Here is my cube model in Rhino.  </p>

		<div class="pic">

		<br><br>
		<h3>Cubes</h3>
		<p class="myp">I was excited that my 3D printer was finally leveled. For the 4 cubes I printed here are the stats </p>
		<div class="pic">
						<img src="pics/finalCubes.png">
					</div>
					<br>
		<table class="imgTable">
       		<tr>
       			<td>
       				<strong>Cube Low Quality</strong><br>
			Time: 19 minutes, 52 seconds<br>
			H: 18mm W: 20mm L: 19.5mm
			<br>
       			</td>
       			<td>
       				<strong>Cube Standard Quality </strong><br>

       		<tr>
       			<td>
       				<strong>Cube Super Quality </strong><br>

       			</td>
       		</tr>
       	</table>


<br><br>
		<h3>Tubes</h3>
		<p class="myp">I moved onto the tubes. For the single extrusion, I made the width of the extrusion 0.4mm to match with the diameter of the extruder. My double extrusion would be 0.8mm. The tubes printed very easily.
		</p>

		<table>
       		<tr>
       			<td>
       				<div class="pic">

       			</td>

			Time: 28 minutes 12 seconds<br>
			H: 24.9mm D: 30mm<br>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

<br><br>
		<h3>Cylinders</h3>
		<p class="myp">When I started printing cylinders, that is where I faced more problems. For the first cylinder, my printer started printing spaghetti printing. I tried printing my other cylinder first, and it was fine so I figured it wasn’t an issue with the bed level but it could have been an issue with the gcode file. After I recreated the file, the cylinder printed normally. I didn't manage to take a picture of my Rhino model but the cylinder is the same as the cylinder on the side without the supports.
		</p>

		<table>
       		<tr>
       			<td>
       				<div class="pic">
						<img src="pics/sideCyl.png">

       			</td>
       			<td>

       			<td>
       				<div class="pic">

				</td>
       		</tr>
       	</table>
<br>
       	<table>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<strong>Cylinder 0.1mm Tolerance </strong><br>
			Time: 1hr 19 minutes 30 seconds<br>
			H: 23.5mm D:30mm<br>
				</td>
				<td>
					<strong>Cylinder 0.001mm Tolerance </strong><br>
			Time: 1hr 19 minutes 30 seconds<br>
			H: 23.9mm D: 30mm<br>
				</td>
				<td>
					<strong>Side Cylinder with Supports </strong><br>
			Time: 59 minutes 52 seconds<br>
			H: 28.5mm W:30mm<br>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

   

		<p class="myp">As for my side cylinder, the layers are really visible because 75% into the print, my screws on the x-axis loosened during the print which made final cylinder look choppy.
		</p>
<br><br>
		<h3>Nested Object</h3>

		<p class="myp">For my nested piece, I decided to go with something Halloween related since it’s right around the corner! I modeled 4 nested pumpkin rings in Rhino (2 of the rings don’t have a stem due to the small size). When I printed this, I had to re-level the bed because I was getting low adhesion. In the end, it turned out really nicely, and I thought it was cute!
