		<p class="myp">For this assignment, I wanted to try out the CNC Mill to learn something new. After lecture, we headed to the MILL to try them out and we managed to get a test cut in! It was pretty fast.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h3>First Steps</h3>

		<p class="myp">My first step was researching boxes and types of box joints online. I saw some really cool boxes, and I wanted to try out dovetail joints initially but I realized those joints were suited for thicker material. The FR1 boards were about 1.4mm thick, so I decided simple finger joints would be the route. Then I used Rhino to create the sides and joints of my box and a dog and bone design. 
		</p>
		
		<br>
		<h3>Rhino</h3>


		<table>
       		<tr>
       			<td>
       				<div class="pic">
						<img src="pics/model1.png">
					</div>
       			</td>
       			<td>
       				<div class="pic">
						<img src="pics/cho.png">
					</div>
				</td>
       		</tr>
       	</table>

		<p class="myp">
			I created my Rhino design based on the size of the FR1 boards, ensuring that I would have enough board space of the sizes of my box walls. I decided on engraving a dog and bone because I love dogs, and they matched the dogbones concept. I also loosely based my dog design on my friend's dog, Cho Cho. I also made sure to differentiate my cuts from my engravings with different colors and layers in Rhino. 
		</p>
		<div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/model2Colors.png">
		</div>

		<br><br>
		<h3>Dogbones</h3>
		<p class="myp"> While finalizing my designs, I had to make sure my dog bones were on both pieces of adjacent joints. Initially I didn't have my dogbones on the protruding sides, but I put them in.</p>
		<br>

		<h3>Importing to KiCAD</h3>

		<p class="myp">After I exported my Rhino files as DXFs, I imported my cut file to KiCAD, and they looked good. However, when I imported my engraving file, something went wrong. I got a weird error saying "Invalid Bezier Curve", and my dog didn't even show up properly. </p>

		
       				<div class="pic">

					</div>
  					<br>
       				<div class="pic">
						<img src="pics/kicadErrorShape.png">
					</div>


					<br>

		<p class="myp">
		My bone was fine though. After some time, I figured out the shapes wouldn't show properly in KiCAD if I used the circle tool in Rhino and manipulated the shape into an ellipse or something organic, so I redrew my dog using the curve tool instead, and the engraving imported properly in KiCAD this time.

  					<br>
  		<br>
		<h3>Creating Gerber Files</h3>
		<p class="myp">This portion was straightforward, thanks to Junchao's slide deck. I created my two Gerber files-- one for cutting and the other for engraving. 

		</p>

  		<br>
		<h3>Setting up the CNC Mill</h3>

		<div class="pic">
						<img src="pics/setup.png">
					</div>
  					<br>
		<p class="myp">I was ready to start using the mill so a few friends and I went to the MILL together for moral support and for safety. We plugged in the machine, put in the end bit, set the Z offset, and taped on the sacrificial layer. 
		</p>

		<p class="myp">I taped my board on for the cut, and I was a bit nervous at first because I only had 2 FR1 boards and I didn't want to mess up (shoutout to Jody for letting me use her extra boards later!)</p>

		<br>
		<h3>Bantam and Cutting</h3>
		<p class="myp"> I made sure to measure the sacrificial layer and my cut layer before cutting so I could input the right dimensions into Bantam, ensuring the mill would cut and engrave at the right depth. Each layer was about 1.4mm. </p>

		<div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/measure.png">
		</div>
  		<br>

		<p class="myp">
		After double checking all the settings, I pressed "Mill All" and my god the sound that the mill makes from spinning at such a high speed was terrifying. I put my hand on the emergency stop button whenever mill was cutting, just in case something went wrong. Nothing went wrong though! 
		</p>
		<div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/cut.png">
		</div>
  		<br>

  		<p class="myp">My first round cuts and engravings went smoothly, so I was really happy about it. I cut another round for my other sides.</p>

  		<table>
       		<tr>
       			<td>
       				<div class="pic">
						<img src="pics/endCut.png">
					</div>
       			</td>
       			<td>
       				<div class="pic">
						<img src="pics/finalCuts.png">
					</div>
				</td>
       		</tr>
       	</table>
       	<br>


		<p class="myp">However, things went wrong with my top and bottom sides. They cut too small, and the machine engraving some parts of it. I didn't have any engravings and Junchao and I couldn't figure out how to fix this error. At this point, I spent 5 hours at the MILL and was too tired to fix it, so I stuck with the sides of my box.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Putting the box together</h3>

		<p class="myp">While putting my pieces together, I had to sand the joints because I didn't size the protruding pieces down in Rhino. I knew about this but I didn't want to change my file again. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Final Box</h3>
		<p class="myp">
			Some of the joints were hard to put together even after I sanded it, but I still managed to put the sides together even though 2 sides were not a snug fit. Next time, I need to make my joints a bit deeper for a tigher fit.
		</p>

       		<tr>
       			<td>
       				<div class="pic">
						<img src="pics/finalBox.png">
					</div>
       			</td>
       			<td>
       				<div class="pic">
