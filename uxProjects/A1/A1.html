		<h3>First Steps</h3>
		<p class="myp">Upon starting this assignment, I had no idea where to begin, so I looked to the assignment examples that were provided through Discord. I started off with sketches to explore different shapes, and it was really hard to imagine what the 3D model would look like from my inital shape. I had no source of inspiration or final object I was aiming for so I decided to create 2 geometric shapes-- a square and an arch. </p>
		<div class="pic">

		</div><br><br><br>
		
		<h3>Initial Prototyping</h3>
       <p class="myp">
       	To test out my shapes before modeling them in Rhino, I used some cardboard recycled from my friend and cut out the shapes and built a small prototype. The structure seemed decent, and I felt like I'd roll with these shapes and decided to model them. I planned to cut 16 of each shape, resulting in 32 total pieces. 

       	<table>
       		<tr>
       			<td>
       				<div class="pic">
						<img src="pics/shapes.png">
					</div>
       			</td>
       			<td>
       				<div class="pic">
						<img src="pics/proto.png">
					</div>
				</td>
       		</tr>
       	</table>
       <br><br><br>

		<h3>Rhino Modeling</h3>
		<p class="myp">
		When modeling everything in Rhino, I had to try a few iterations to get exactly what I wanted mainly because I had to adjust the thickness of the slots to be less than the thickness of my cardboard to ensure the pieces would fit together. My cardboard was about 5-6mm thick, so I decided to make the slots around 4mm. I realized because a lot of my slots were angled, grid snap wouldn't give me the exact 45 degree positioning I wanted. I used the function CurveBoolean to get my desired shapes, which took a few tries but I managed to land on my final shapes to export to Illustrator. </p>

      <h3>Laser Cutting</h3><br>

      <div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/laser.png">
		</div>

      <p class="myp">
This was the coolest part of the project! 1. Because I would be learning how to laser cut, and 2. Watching the laser cut in action was mesmerizing. For this portion, it took me a few tries to get the ideal cut. Before cutting my 32 shapes, I wanted to test my shapes to see if they'd cut and fit together properly. </p>
		<div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/testcuts.png">
		</div>

<p class="myp">My first cut didn't even cut through because my cardboard was too thick. My laser cutter settings were 25% speed, 50% power, and 50% frequency, which was the default for 5mm of material. I changed the settings to 20% speed, 55% power, and 50% frequency to see if slower speed and more power would help the laser cut through. It was a slighly better job, but still not all the way through, so my final settings were <b>15% speed, 55% power, and 50% frequency</b>, which helped me pop out my pieces more easily. </p>

		<table>
       		<tr>
       			<td>
       				<div class="pic">

       			</td>
       			<td>

		<h3>Putting Everything Together</h3>
		<p class="myp">As I mentioned earlier, I had no idea what my final shape would look like, so I started putting the pieces together, alternating the shape that was adjacent to each other, and the final result looked like an octopus &#128025; of some sort! I was pretty happy with it. </p>

		<h3>3D Model</h3>
		<p class="myp">Here is the 3D rendering of my shapes at 6mm thickness because my cardboard was that thick. For some reason my Rhino renders 3D shapes that don't look solid. Even when I create a 3D shape from scratch it doesn't look solid but it is! </p>
