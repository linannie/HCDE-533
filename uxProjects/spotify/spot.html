		<h3>Grasshopper</h3>

		<p class="myp">Since I had already done laser cutting last week, I felt more confident with this assignment, but I didn't have as much faith in my Grasshopper knowledge, so I started off with watching the video of the second week's lecture to familiarzie myself with the logic and Grasshopper file. I created two new Grasshopper files to make my new shapes.</p> 
		<table>
       		<tr>
       			<td>
       				<div class="pic">
						<img src="pics/gh.png">
					</div>
       			</td>
       			<td>
       				<div class="pic">
						<img src="pics/2dshape.png">
					</div>
				</td>
       		</tr>
       	</table>

       	<p class="myp">For each shape, I used the 'Polygon' function in Grasshopper to choose the number of sides and size of the shape. For a square I chose 4 and a hexagon I chose 6 sides; both shapes had a radius of 20mm.</p>
       	<div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/rect2.png">
		</div><br><br>

		<p class="myp">Then to create the rectangle cutouts, the main functions I used were 'Move', 'Vector XYZ', and 'Polar Array'. 'Move' allows the rectangle to move based on the information fed into 'Vector XYZ'. The vector was determined through moving the X and Y component. The X component was deteremined by half the width of the rectangle, which would center it on the shape. Y component was decided based on the radius of the shape, which allowed the rectangle to show up on the inside of the outer edge of the shape. </p>
       	<div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/rect.png">
		</div><br><br>

		<p class="myp">'Polar Array' was then used to create repeating cutouts around the shape, of which I created 4. Then for each shape, I trimmed the inner regions of the cutouts from the outer shape and baked after joining the curves.</p>
		<div class="pic">

		</div><br><br>
		<p class="myp">

			 To model it in 3D to represent the variable thickness in cardboard, I used the 'Extrude' function with a number slider to vary the Z axis of the shape, and I used the 'Surface' function to cap the shapes. Here are the results. 
		</p>
		<div class="pic myp">

		</div><br><br>
		<p class="myp">

			 I left my square shape the same as the one from last week, but I wasn't sure how to create my arch shape (since it wasn't symmetrical on the x-axis), so I decided to create a hexagon. I learned how to use the Polygon function in grasshopper from a video. With these two new shapes, I grabbed cardboard from recycle bins on red square and headed to the MILL to cut 15 of each shape, resuting in 30 shapes.

		<h3>Test Cuts</h3>
		<p class="myp">After modeling my Grasshopper files in Rhino, I had to test out my shapes and determine the settings on the laser cutter machine because my cardboard was quite thick-- roughly <strong>6.51mm</strong>. </p>

		<div class="pic myp">
			<img src="pics/thick.png">
		</div><br><br>

		<p class="myp">Of course, the first few times I tested out the cuts, the laser didn't even cut through. My final settings were <strong>15% speed, 100% power, and 50% frequency</strong>. I guess I needed a lot of power to cut through my thick cardboard</p>

		<h3>Final Shapes</h3>
		<p class="myp">These are my final shapes. </p>

		<h3>Putting Everything Together</h3>

		<p class="myp">I made my structure a rectangluar conctraption that could be an abstraction of a car. It was very different from my Assignment 1 octopus, and I was pretty happy with this. </p>
