		<h2>Concept</h2>


		<p class="myp">For my final project I made a clock decoration. Initially I was thinking about making the mechanical portion, but I decided to make it a wall decoration because I feel like I needed more time to make the weight and pendulum portion more accurate. To design the  clock decoration, I learned about gear ratios and compound gears, since the mechanism of the hour, minute, and second hand rotations depend on each other through gears.  </p> <br>


			<b>Techniques Used:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Laser cutting - gears, base frame, minute hand</li>
				<li>Rhino - to model the gears and parts</li>
				<li>Grasshopper - to model the gears through parametric design</li>
				<li>3D printing - printed wall mounts and dowels</li>
			</ul>
		<br>
		<b>The parts used to build the clock or decor:</b>

		<ul>
				<li>Gear Train</li>
				<li>Escapement Mechanism</li>
				<li>Weight + Pendulum</li>
				<li>Base to attach everything to</li>
				<li>Minute hand</li>
				<li>Dowels</li>
				<li>Wall mounts</li>
				<li>Rubber bands, glue</li>
			</ul>
			<br><br>

		<h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
		<h3>Step 1 - Calculating Gear Ratios</h3>
	
		<p class="myp">

			For the gear ratios, I used 60:1 gear ratio of the minute hand (1 full rotation for 60 minutes) and a 12:1 gear ratio for the hour (1 full rotation for 12 hours). In the end, I ended up just using the minute hand ratio and got rid of the hour hand. The 60:1 gear ratio is pretty big, so I broke up the ratio to 2:1, 5:1, and 6:1, and I left the 12:1 gear ratio as is. </p><br>

		
		<h3>Gear Train Possibilities</h3>

		<p class="myp">
		I developed 2 possible sketches depending on the 3D orientation of my clock/mechanism. (This sketch isn’t showing the final 3D orientation.) I would have 8 or 9 gears with teeth based on the gear ratios. In the first sketch, I have 9 gears because the minute and hour hand are separate. In the second sketch the minute and hour gears are co-axial and the total number of gears is 8. The sketches also show the number of teeth each gear would have.

		<h3>Step 2 - Surveying Parts at Ace Hardware</h3>
		<p class="myp">

			Before I designed anything, I needed to look at a few parts so I could design my gears based on that. The part I was looking at was the axel for the gears, so I could make a hole in the gear design based on the diameter of the axel. I found a dowel about 3/8” in diameter that I decided to use on the center of my gears
		</p>
		<p class="myp"> I also got some scrap wood from the store, which I measured and used for my test cuts. The thickness was about 6.2mm.</p>

       		<tr>
       			<td>
       				<div class="pic">

					</div>
				</td>
       		</tr>
       	</table>

		<br>

		<h3>Step 3 - Designing the gears in Rhino</h3>

				<p class="myp">
		For this step I accomplished:<br>

		- Rhino modeling ✅<br>
		- Grasshopper parametric design ✅</p>

	<div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/gearPart.png">
		</div>
		
		<p class="myp">For this part, I had to understand the parts of a gear like the pitch and base diameter. Luckily there were a few plugins that I found on Google that I could use with Rhino to help me model my gears (but I had to model the escapement gear and small gears myself). I downloaded a Python a plugin <b>geargen</b> to design my gears. It took inputs such as the Base Diameter and number of teeth to create a 2D curve of my gear, and this gave me an output of the outline of a gear. 
			</p>

			<div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/plugin.png">
		</div><br><br>

		<p class="myp">

		I had to cut out the center for the dowel, and cut out parts of the shape so it wouldn’t be completely solid. Using the plugin I designed gears B, D, and F.</p>

		<div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/gearRhino.png">
		</div><br>

		<h4>Parametric Design</h4>
		<p class="myp">Unfortunately, the plugin I used had a minimum input for the number (17 teeth) of teeth on a gear, and the smallest gear from my design had 9 teeth, so I decided to model it myself. I created a curve shape that looked like a tooth on a gear. Using grasshopper, I revolved the curve around a Base Diameter, I bake the circle and the revolved curves and Boolean Unioned to create a gear shape. Similarly, I did this for the escapement gear except the teeth were triangles.</p> <br>

					<p class="myp">

		For the escapement gear, I used the Grasshopper similarly but used a triangular curve to make the teeth.</p>

		<h3>Step 4 - Fabricating</h3>

				<p class="myp">
		For this step I accomplished <br>

		- Laser Cutting ✅ <br>
		- 3D Printing ✅</p>
		<p class="myp">
		My next step was laser cutting the gears. I went to the MILL before Thanksgiving to do some test cuts and I ended up with a few gears. I realized I calculated a gear to be the wrong ratio, so I had to go back to the MILL later to cut some more gears. </p>

		<br><br>
		<b>Gear Pieces</b>
		<p class="myp">Here are all my pieces that I laser cut for the gear train and escapement mechanism.</p>
		<div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/pieces.png">
		</div>

		<br><br>

		<b>Dowels </b>
		<p class="myp">
		I went back to the hardware store to test the dowels and I found the aluminum dowel that fit my gears!</p>

		<div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/dowelCheck.png">
		</div>
		<p class="myp">
		 However, they were sold out of the wooden dowel in the size I wanted, so I decided to 3D print my own. My 3D printed dowels were 3/8” in diameter and 7cm long. </p>
		 <div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/dowel.png">
		</div>




		<br><br>
		<h3>Step 5 - Designing a Mounting System</h3>
		<p class="myp">
			

		After I cut all the gears out and printed the dowels, I had to assemble everything together somehow. I hadn’t planned out a base frame at this point, so I sketched a few ideas. I knew I had to attach the dowels to the same plane so the gears that touched would be in the right spot. I laid paper down and traced the placement of each dowel based on the correct orientation of the gear train I wanted and measured the distance in between each dowel.  (I’m sure there are ways to calculate the distance between gears, but I didn’t feel like doing math.) The distance between the axels were: 33mm, 71mm, and 90mm.</p>


		 <div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/measure2.png">
		</div>
		 <div class="pic"><br>
			<img src="pics/frame.png">
		</div>

		<p class="myp">
		I went back to the MILL to cut a base rectangle to attach my dowels to and I designed a wall mount for my dowels, which I ended up 3D printing. </p>

		 <div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/mount.png">
		</div>

		<p class="myp">
		<span style="color: red"><b>Problem 1:</b></span> I realized a few of my gears (escapement and hour gear train)would actually coincide with the dowels. I could’ve made a bigger escapement wheel or a different ratios.</p>
		 <div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/error.png">
		</div>

		<p class="myp">
		<b>Fix:</b> Based on this and how much time I had left, I decided to get rid of the hour gear train completely and orient the escapement wheel differently than I had planned.

		</p> <br>


		<h3>Step 6 - Assembly and Troubleshooting</h3>

		<p class="myp">Here’s the part that took me the most time!</p>

		 <div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/allPieces.png">
		</div>

		<h4>Glueing</h4>
		<p class="myp">
		First I glued the gears to the dowels so they would be secure and not spin freely. I put the gears in place on my base frame and tested the wall mounts. Right away there were a few problems. </p>

		<p class="myp">
		<span style="color: red"><b>Problem 2:</b></span> I didn’t account for the weights of the gears, so some of the gears drooped while they were in the mounts.</p>
		 <div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/wall1.png">
		</div> 

		<p class="myp">
		<b>Fix:</b> Double up on wall mounts. I added another wall mount on top of the first one, so it would alleviate the drooping.</p>

		<p class="myp">
		<span style="color: red"><b>Problem 3:</b></span> While manual turning the gears, I noticed some of the gears were shifting back and forth and wobbling. </p>

		 <div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/rubber.png">
		</div> 

		<p class="myp">
		<b>Fix:</b> I used rubber bands to stop the shifting and made sure there was adequate spacing in between gears so they wouldn't have too much friction. </p>

		<br><br>
		<b>Everything put together</b><br>
		<p class="myp">Here is what the clock decoration looks like after everything is attached and glued properly</p>

		 <div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/finalOrient.png">
		</div> 
		<br><br>
		

		<h2>Final Result</h2>
		<p class="myp">Here is the final wall decoration I created! It's a pretty cool wall piece, and if you move it manually, you can still see the gears move with each other. The timekeeping portion didn't work out so I ended up with a cool wall decoration, which didn't deviate too much from the original design.</p>

		</div>
		<br><br>

		<h3>Extra Step I Tried - Weight and Pendulum</h3>
		<p class="myp">This was the portion where I decided to get rid of the automatic timekeeping portion completely because I didn't have enough time to calculate the length and weight used. I still tried out an arbitraty numbers for the weight and pendulum but found out I had too much fricition between the teeth of my gears. I used a bag of rice as the weight and laser cut the pendulum peices (glued them together)</p>

		<div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/weight.png">
		</div> 
		<div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/pend.png">
		</div> 

		<p class="myp">I tested the weight on the escapement gear, which worked well. </p>

		<!-- gif of thing-->

		<div class="pic">
			<img src="pics/weight2.png">
		</div> 

		<p class="myp">
		However, when I put the weight on the final gear train, my gears had too much friction with each other, so even with the weight, the escapement mechanism wouldn't run smoothly. If I had to fabricate the gears again, I would 3D print the gear train because PLA filament would likely produce less friction. </p><br><br>
